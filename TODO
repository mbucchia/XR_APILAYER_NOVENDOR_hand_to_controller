Tracking:

* Cache hand poses to deduplicate 3 similar calls (xrLocateSpace, xrSyncActions and xrEndFrame).
* Improve gesture detection robustness.

Graphics:

* Support DX12, probably can use d3d11on12.
* Implement alpha blending in the shader to support hands opacity.
* Improve the visuals of the hands.
* Add an option to bypass d3d context restore (needs to change scissors in the rendering). Might help with perf.

Config tool:

* Implement loading of existing config file.

Non-WMR support:

* Fix workaround at layer creation (create aux XrInstance instead).
* Proper error handling/reporting everywhere in the code.

Install script:

* Make a proper installer.

Stretch-goals (to support beyond MSFS):

* OpenXR compliance issues (XrSession, XrActionSet, behavior of unhandled actions...).
* Proper support of imageArrayIndex for swapchains.
* Performance statistics telemetry?
