Bug fixes:

* (#1) Binding multiple gestures to the same action does not work.

Tracking:

* Change behavior when hand tracking is lost.
* Cache hand poses to deduplicate 3 similar calls (xrLocateSpace, xrSyncActions and xrEndFrame).
* Improve gesture detection robustness.

Graphics:

* Implement alpha blending in the shader to support hands opacity.
* Add an option to bypass d3d context restore (needs to change scissors in the rendering). Might help with perf.

Haptics:

* (#2) Play audio instead of haptics.
* Bind haptics + current gesture to an action (eg: to simulate button presses with "finger gun" gesture).

Config tool:

* Add grip pose offset axis correction to reflect proper X/Y/Z axes.

Misc:

* Proper error handling/reporting everywhere in the code.
* Add hotkeys for certain desired behaviors (eg: disable left/right hand).

Stretch-goals:

* Support DX12, probably can use d3d11on12.
* Improve the visuals of the hands.
* OpenXR compliance issues (XrSession, XrActionSet, behavior of unhandled actions...).
* Proper support of imageArrayIndex for swapchains.
* Performance statistics
